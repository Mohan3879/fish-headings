# fish-headings
Collapsible headings for website navigation.

### What is this?

This is a reusable and responsive component for navigating through a text-heavy site.

It is easiest to demonstrate 
[by example](http://mister-fish.net/migranten).

The component comes in view as you scroll down, and responds to scroll events to update itself.

It works particularly well as a sticky element ('affixed' in Bootstrap terminology).

Please note that this is a WIP.
